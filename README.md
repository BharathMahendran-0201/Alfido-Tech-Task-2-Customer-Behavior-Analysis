# Customer Behavior Analysis

**Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior patterns to understand their preferences, purchasing habits, and overall engagement with products or services. The analysis aims to uncover insights that can help in making data-driven business decisions, improving customer satisfaction, and driving sales growth.

**Objectives**

- **Identify Key Customer Segments:** Segment customers based on their behavior to tailor marketing strategies and improve retention.
- **Analyze Purchase Patterns:** Study purchase history to understand what drives customer decisions and identify top-performing products.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Use historical data to predict future customer behaviors and preferences.
- **Data Visualization:** Create visual representations of the data to communicate insights clearly and effectively.

**Data**

The dataset used in this analysis includes the following features:
- `Customer ID`: Unique identifier for each customer.
- `Age`: Age of the customer.
- `Gender`: Gender of the customer.
- `Income`: Annual income of the customer.
- `Purchase History`: A record of products purchased by the customer.
- `Product Categories`: Categories of products purchased.
- `Region`: Geographic location of the customer.

**Tools and Technologies**

- **Python:** For data manipulation, analysis, and modeling.
- **Pandas:** For data cleaning, aggregation, and analysis.
- **NumPy:** For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn:** For implementing machine learning models.

**Project Structure**

- `data/`: Contains the raw and processed customer data files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step analysis and modeling.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data processing, feature engineering, and model training.
- `reports/`: Generated reports and visualizations based on the analysis.
